What is Grover?

Grover is like Netflix for gadgets. Instead of buying expensive tech outright, you rent it for a flexible monthly fee. Theyâ€™ve got pretty much everything â€” phones, laptops, tablets, gaming consoles, headphones, even smart TVs.
ðŸ’¡ Why would you rent tech instead of buying?

    Lower upfront cost â€“ You donâ€™t have to drop â‚¬1,000 on a laptop or console. Instead, you pay a smaller monthly fee.

    Flexibility â€“ Need something for 1 month, 3 months, or longer? You decide how long you keep it.

    Always up to date â€“ Tech moves fast. Renting means you can easily swap to the newest model when your subscription ends.

    Try before you commit â€“ Not sure if that iPad or PlayStation 5 is worth it? Rent it, test it, then decide if you want to buy.

    Peace of mind â€“ Grover includes insurance against accidental damage, so youâ€™re covered if something happens.

    Sustainable â€“ Devices get reused and recycled instead of gathering dust in a drawer or ending up as e-waste.

ðŸŽ® Example Scenarios

    Want a PlayStation 5 for a few months while a new game drops? Rent it, then return it.

    Need a laptop for a short project or while traveling? Rent instead of buying a second device.

    Thinking about switching to a foldable phone but not sure? Rent it first.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: Grover makes tech more affordable, flexible, and sustainable. You get the latest gadgets without being locked into ownership, and you only pay while you actually use them.
