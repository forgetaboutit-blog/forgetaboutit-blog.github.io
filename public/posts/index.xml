<p>What is Grover?</p>
<p>Grover is like Netflix for gadgets. Instead of buying expensive tech outright, you rent it for a flexible monthly fee. Theyâ€™ve got pretty much everything â€” phones, laptops, tablets, gaming consoles, headphones, even smart TVs.
ðŸ’¡ Why would you rent tech instead of buying?</p>
<pre><code>Lower upfront cost â€“ You donâ€™t have to drop â‚¬1,000 on a laptop or console. Instead, you pay a smaller monthly fee.

Flexibility â€“ Need something for 1 month, 3 months, or longer? You decide how long you keep it.

Always up to date â€“ Tech moves fast. Renting means you can easily swap to the newest model when your subscription ends.

Try before you commit â€“ Not sure if that iPad or PlayStation 5 is worth it? Rent it, test it, then decide if you want to buy.

Peace of mind â€“ Grover includes insurance against accidental damage, so youâ€™re covered if something happens.

Sustainable â€“ Devices get reused and recycled instead of gathering dust in a drawer or ending up as e-waste.
</code></pre>
<p>ðŸŽ® Example Scenarios</p>
<pre><code>Want a PlayStation 5 for a few months while a new game drops? Rent it, then return it.

Need a laptop for a short project or while traveling? Rent instead of buying a second device.

Thinking about switching to a foldable phone but not sure? Rent it first.
</code></pre>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ In short: Grover makes tech more affordable, flexible, and sustainable. You get the latest gadgets without being locked into ownership, and you only pay while you actually use them.</p>
<p>I think youâ€™ll like renting tech with Grover.

Managed to get 9 flags. Must admit the report writing is the hard part and don&amp;rsquo;t wait until last minute to start working on the report. Try and capture the steps and screenshots throughout the engagement. After anxiously waiting for the results I decided to modify an existing python script to monitor the exam result. As to give something back to the community I adjusted it to make use of Mailgun - to send the email.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Friday 25 September I completed the exam and submitted the report!

After anxiously waiting for the results I decided to modify an existing python script to monitor the exam result.
As to give something back to the community I adjusted it to make use of Mailgun - to send the email.
It&rsquo;s deployed using GitHub Actions with a cron schedule and can also then be run manually.</p>

This is especially true as you will need to be thinking about chaining as well. None of the targets would be expliotable with just running automated tools. There&amp;rsquo;s also the extra difficulty of &amp;ldquo;chaining&amp;rdquo; vulns. I found the following video nicely explain &amp;ldquo;Creative thinking&amp;rdquo; by Professor Po-Shen from the Carnegie Mellon University.

Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong the modules are good but in my opinion doesnt prepare you fully for the exam. I had to found out there&amp;rsquo;s some golden nugget modules available that will be an advantage to complete.
Take a look at the learning process module:

The other module that was also mentioned by someone else, unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall but seems to be also valuable for learning black box testing.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel there&rsquo;s some missing pieces to HTB CBBH training.

<p>The other module that was also mentioned by someone else, unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t recall but seems to be also valuable for learning black box testing.</p>
<p>External testing section of the Attacking Enterprise Networks.</p>
<p>The other one is the Documentation and Reporting module. ( not part of the CBBH path currently )</p>
<p>CBBH covers a broad range of web vulns but mastering the most commonly exploited attacks vectors are crucial.</p>
<p>Critical to understand how to exploit black box vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Black box = PortSwigger Academy</p>
<p>And note all injections could be blind. I will add htb module links soon.</p>
